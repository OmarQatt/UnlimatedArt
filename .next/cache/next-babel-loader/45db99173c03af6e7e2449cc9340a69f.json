Of that number, only 15 remained after a 13-day ordeal at sea that included incidents of cannibalism among the desperate men. The larger-than-life-size painting, distinguished by a dramatic pyramidal composition, captures the moment the raft’s emaciated crew spots a rescue ship. Géricault undertook the massive canvas on his own, without anyone paying for it, and approached it much like an investigative reporter, interviewing survivors and making numerous detailed studies based on their testimony.</p></div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div>\r\n                  <div className={styles.blogimage}><Image src=\"/img/ART10.jpg\" width={430} height={320} alt=\"\" /></div>\r\n                      <div className={styles.blogitem}>\r\n                      \r\n                      <h3>Girl with a Pearl Earring </h3>\r\n                          <p>\r\n                          Johannes Vermeer’s 1665 study of a young woman is startlingly real and startlingly modern, almost as if it were a photograph.
